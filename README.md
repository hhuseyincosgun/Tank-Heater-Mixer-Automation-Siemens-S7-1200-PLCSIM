# üõ¢Ô∏è Tank-Heater-Mixer Automation (Siemens S7-1200 + PLCSIM)


This project is a **Tank-Heater-Mixer automation system** developed using Siemens S7-1200 series PLC and **TIA Portal with PLCSIM**. The system automatically controls the liquid level, temperature, and mixing process, and can be fully tested in a simulation environment.

## üîß Hardware and Software Used

- **PLC:** Siemens S7-1200 (example: CPU 1214C DC/DC/RLY)
- **Programming Language:** Ladder Diagram (Ladder Logic)
- **Software:**
  - TIA Portal (v16 or later)
  - PLCSIM (for virtual PLC simulation)
- **Inputs/Outputs:**
  - Digital Inputs: Start/Stop buttons, level sensors and 
  - Digital Outputs: Valves, heater and mixer motor control
  - Analog Input: Pt100(Resistance Temperature Detector) 


## üß™ Testing with PLCSIM

This project can be fully tested using **PLCSIM** without requiring real PLC hardware. The virtual PLC can be run within TIA Portal, and system behavior can be observed. Inputs can be triggered manually to simulate sensor signals.

## üîÅ Automation Process


1. When the **Start** button is pressed, the system is activated.
2. The **filling valve** opens, and the tank starts filling with liquid.
3. Once the **upper level sensor** detects liquid, the filling process stops.
4. If the liquid temperature is **between 45¬∞C and 50¬∞C**, the **heater and mixer** are activated.
5. When the temperature reaches between **45-55¬∞C**, the **drain valve** opens to discharge the tank.
6. When the **lower level sensor** no longer detects liquid, draining stops.
7. The system then returns to the beginning and waits for the next cycle.
8. Pressing the **Stop** button deactivates the system.

### SM 1231 RTD
The standard CPU does not support direct RTD inputs, we installed an RTD module (e.g., SM 1231 RTD for Siemens PLCs) to read the Pt100 sensor accurately

### RTD Module Hardware Configuration (for Pt100)

In this project, the **Resistance Thermometer (RTD)** is connected using a **3-wire configuration (3√ó1.5 mm¬≤)**, which is ideal for medium-range distances between **10 to 150 meters**.

#### üîç Why 3-Wire RTD is Used

- The **3-wire RTD** is a widely accepted industrial standard that helps **minimize the error caused by lead wire resistance**.
- It offers a good balance between **measurement accuracy** and **cable cost**, compared to:
  - **2-wire**: simpler but less accurate (affected more by cable resistance)
  - **4-wire**: most accurate, but more expensive and complex

### üî¢ Analog Input Configuration ‚Äì Channel 0 (IW96)

In this project, we are using **Channel 0 (IW96)** of the analog input module to read temperature values.

- The connected thermal resistor is a **Pt100 RTD sensor**, commonly used in industrial temperature measurement applications.
- The signal is processed as an **analog input word (IW96)** in the PLC program.
- The RTD provides a resistance value proportional to temperature, which is interpreted by the PLC through this analog input.



### üß© System Design Workflow ‚Äì I/O Planning and Tag Definition

Before writing any PLC code, it is essential to **define all inputs and outputs** required by the system and select the hardware accordingly.
   - After the hardware is selected, define all required **tags** in the TIA Portal project.
   - Tags should follow a **consistent naming convention** (e.g., `I_Start_Button`, `Q_Heater`, `AI_Temperature_PT100`) for clarity and maintainability.

> üõ†Ô∏è This planning phase ensures that the system is scalable, maintainable, and compatible with both the physical setup and software logic.
